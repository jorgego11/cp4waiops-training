Both share information and can be tracked together. To ensure that this integration operates effectively, you must configure ServiceNow and ServiceNow integration in IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps. \n\nAfter you configure ServiceNow and IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps, the updates that you make in IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps will flow into the Agent Workspace of ServiceNow. \n\nUpdates to event data and the state of your story in IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps appear in ServiceNow. Any updates that you make in Slack or Microsoft Teams to the description, short description, or severity after you create the story do not overwrite the existing values in ServiceNow. Also, edits that are made in ServiceNow (changing descriptions or incident names, for example) are not reflected in Slack, Microsoft Teams, or IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps.\n\n\n## 游닌 STEP: Update existing Users in ServiceNow\n\n\nBefore you create your integration, you must assign IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps roles to your users in ServiceNow.\n\n1. Log in to your ServiceNow developer instance.\n2. In the filter field, search for users as shown below:\n\n    ![users](./../images/snow/users.png)\n\n3. Click User Administration > Users to see the list of users as shown below:\n\n    ![users](./../images/snow/user-list.png)\n\n4. You need two different users. Assign at least one user to each role.\n\n      **Notes:** In both cases ensure that your IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps users in ServiceNow are assigned the itil role in ServiceNow. The itil role enables them to have access to the Agent Workspace. If the user does not have access to the Agent Workspace, they cannot work on incidents in ServiceNow and receive a permissions error.\n\n      **Important:** Ensure that the time zone of your Events user (the user value that is used to create your ServiceNow integration) matches your system time zone in ServiceNow. If the two values are not synchronized, the flow of your change request data from ServiceNow to IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps is disrupted.\n      \n      \n\n## 游닌 STEP: User 1 - abraham.lincoln\n\n\n1. Select user `abraham.lincoln`\n\n2. Select `Roles` Tab\n3. Click `Edit`\n4. Assign the following roles\n\n\t* `x_ibm_waiops.watson_aiops_admin `\n\t* `itil`\n\n\t![events user](./../images/snow/user-lincoln-roles.png)\n\t\t\n\t\t\n\t`x_ibm_waiops.watson_aiops_admin`: An administrative user who can configure instances, URLs, usernames, and passwords in ServiceNow. The admin user is the only user who can see the menu options to configure IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps in ServiceNow. \n\t    \n\n4. Save\t\n5. Set the password to P4ssw0rd!\n6. Click Update on the user page\n\n\t![events user](./../images/snow/user-lincoln.png)\n\t\n\n\n\n\n## 游닌 STEP: User 2 - abel.tuter\n\n\n\n1. Select user `abel.tuter`\n\n2. Select `Roles` Tab\n3. Click `Edit`\n4. Assign the following roles\n\n\t* `x_ibm_waiops.watson_aiops_events_user`\n\t* `itil`\n\t* `cmdb_read`\n\t* `rest_api_explorer`\n\t* `service_viewer`\n\t* `web_service_admin`\n\n\t![events user](./../images/snow/user-abel-roles.png)\n\t\n\t\n\t`x_ibm_waiops.watson_aiops_events_user`: A non-administrative user who is required to insert IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps data into ServiceNow and is configured as the connector between IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps and ServiceNow. \n\t**Important:** Ensure that you select Internal Integration User when you create or edit your Events user (the user that is used in your ServiceNow integration). Your integration user exists to exchange data between ServiceNow and IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps and does not require access to the ServiceNow interface.\n\n\n4. Save\t\n5. Set the password to P4ssw0rd!\n6. Click Update on the user page\n\n\t![events user](./../images/snow/user-abel.png)\n\t\n\n\n\n\n\n\n## 游닌 STEP: ServiceNow Service Management configuration\n\n\n1. Log in to your ServiceNow developer instance.\n2. In the filter field, search for Watson AIOps as shown in the following picture:\n\n    ![search](./../images/snow/search4waiops.png)\n\n3. Click Configuration.\n4. Enter values for the following fields as shown in the next picture.\n\n    * URL for AIOps connection: The URL of your CP4WAIOPS instance in the format of protocol://hostname:port.\n\n      **Note:** If you use a tunnel to expose the server for the ServiceNow connection, you must replace the URL with the forwarding address of the tunnel.\n\n    * Name of the Watson AIOps instance: `aimanager` (As of CP4WAIOPS V3.1.1this is a fixed value.)\n\n    * User name for AIOps connection: `admin` (The username for the IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps instance.)\n\n    * Password for AIOps connection: `Your password for admin`. (The password for the IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps instance.)\n\n    ![configuration](./../images/snow/configuration.png)\n\n5. Click on the Save button in the top right. \n\n\n## 游닌 STEP: Similar incident search configuration\n\n\nWhile not necessary, configuring similar incident search in ServiceNow facilitates problem resolution from within the ServiceNow interface. Configuring similar incident search enables Watson AIOps Similar Incidents in Agent Assist. You can use Agent Assist to look for other tickets that share details with the ticket that you're reviewing. Similar incident search uses the Similar incident model that you trained in IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps.\n\n**Important:** To complete this task, you must be assigned the admin role in ServiceNow, otherwise you cannot configure Search contexts.\n\n1. Log in to your ServiceNow developer instance.\n2. In the filter field, search for `Search contexts` as shown below:\n\n    ![configuration](./../images/snow/search-context.png)\n\n3. Click `Incident Deflection` to open the Incident Deflection record.\n4. Click the `Additional Resource Configurations` tab, then click `Edit` as shown below. \n\n    **Note:** You may see a this message: \"This record is in the Global application, but IBM Watson AIOps is the current application. To edit this record click here\". Click on here to go to the Global application and switch to the Global application.\n    \n    **Note:** If you don't see the `Edit` button, go to `Settings` (cog in the top right corner), select `Developer` and under `Applications` select `Global` from the drop-down.\n\n    ![configuration](./../images/snow/additional-resources.png)\n\n5. Select `Watson AIOps Similar Incidents` from the Collection column and add it to the Additional Resource Configurations List, then click Save.\n\n    ![config-list](./../images/snow/config-list.png)\n\n6. (Optional) You can adjust the order of how the search elements appear by adjusting the Order attribute.\n7. Save your Incident Deflection record.\n\nWatson AIOps Similar Incidents now appears as an option to search by in the Agent Assist.\n\n\n\n","type":"Mdx","contentDigest":"aceeb885ffc67233daf8184b888892ab","owner":"gatsby-plugin-mdx","counter":267},"frontmatter":{"title":"Configuring ServiceNow","date":"2022-11-03T09:57:46.000Z","weight":194},"exports":{},"rawBody":"---\ntitle: \"Configuring ServiceNow\"\ndate: 2022-11-03T10:57:46+01:00\nweight: 194\n---\n\n\n\nYou can create stories in IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps and issues in ServiceNow simultaneously.

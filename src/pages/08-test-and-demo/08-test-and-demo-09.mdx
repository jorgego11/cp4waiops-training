Notice, that alerts are not sorted by severity, but the AI engine ranked them by relevance. The ones that are likely related to the root cause are at the top. Letâ€™s look at the first row for some more details. 

>**ðŸš€ <u>Action</u>**
Click on the first Alert in the list. 

**ðŸ“£ <u>Narration</u>**

In the **Alert details,** you can see different types of groupings explaining why the specific alert was added to the story.

## ðŸ“¥ STEP: Scope based grouping

>**ðŸš€ <u>Action</u>**
Click on **Information** to close the section and click on **Scope-based grouping**.

**ðŸ“£ <u>Narration</u>**

Some alerts were added to the story because they occurred on the same resource within a short period (default is a 15 minutes window)

## ðŸ“¥ STEP: Topological grouping

>**ðŸš€ <u>Action</u>**
Click **Topological grouping**.

**ðŸ“£ <u>Narration</u>**

Other alerts were grouped because they occurred on logically or physically related topology resources. This correlation is using the application topology service that stitches topology information from different sources.

## ðŸ“¥ STEP: Temporal grouping

>**ðŸš€ <u>Note</u>**
Although this Lab does not show examples of Temporal grouping, this is what you would see in a real scenario**.

Finally, the temporal correlation adds to the story events that are known to occur together in the past, in a short time window. What is most important here, is the fact that all these correlations happen automatically â€“ there is no need to define any manual rules. In highly dynamic and distributed cloud-native applications, this is a huge advantage that saves a lot of time and effort.


>**ðŸš€ <u>Action</u>**
**Close** the Alert details window.

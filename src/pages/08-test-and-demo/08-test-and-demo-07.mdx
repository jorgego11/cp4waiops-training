The Story regroups all relevant information concerning the incident at hand that have been identified by Watson AIOps.

1. A list of Alerts that have been identified by Watson AIOps to be the most probable cause. 
2. The localization of the problem related to the Topology. Note that, depending on the Alert type, when you click on the Alert some may show Metric Anomaly Details instead of Topology.
3. The suggested Runbooks to automatically mitigate the incident
4. Similar Incidents that resemble the incident at hand
5. Status of the Story - here I can change the status, priority and assignees of the story. Note that by leveraging a (Story) Policy, the Story has been preassigned to the Demo user.
6. Also note that on the right, when you click on Impacted Applications it will mention RobotShop

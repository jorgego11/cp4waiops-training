**📣 <u>Narration</u>**

Now that we know what is going on and the root cause, let’s fix the problem. A runbook has been automatically identified but have not been executed. Runbooks are guided steps that IT operations teams use to troubleshoot and resolve problems. Some organizations might call these standard operating procedures or playbooks. When an incident occurs, IBM Cloud Pak for Watson AIOps can match an appropriate runbook to the problem at hand. The runbook can be set to run automatically when it is matched to an incident, or it can run with user approval and participation. 

Let’s execute the Runbook.

>**🚀 <u>Action</u>**
>
>On the card representing the **RobotShop Mitigate MySQL Problem** runbook, click on the three dots and select **Run**
>
>Then, on the **Run runbook** page, click **Start runbook** on the bottom right.

**❗ <u>Note</u>**: The execution of the runbook can take few minutes.

**📣 <u>Narration</u>**

The Runbook that I just started kicks off a Playbook on Ansible Tower. These Playbooks were made available after I completed the Ansible Tower integration in the previous steps. I can follow the execution as it connects to the cluster and then scales up memory for the **mysql** deployment.

>When finished, click **Complete**. Before providing feedback (rate the runbook), we will confirm that the ratings problem has been fixed in the RobotShop ecommerce application. 
>
>Open the RobotShop application. Verify that ratings are correctly shown.

The runbook has resolved the problem. When I tell Watson AIOps that the Runbook worked, it will help the runbook owner and other SREs validate the runbook usage and its effectiveness.
